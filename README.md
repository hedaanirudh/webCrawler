# Web Crawler

This is a simple-focused web crawler designed to crawl 1000 web pages of a specific domain starting from georgia tech's website. It uses DFS to identify URLs and subsequent scrape data from it. It reads the contents, extracts keywords by calculating the TF-IDF scores of the words per page and then finally stores this data, the indexed words and all the statistics captured during the process in an Excel.
